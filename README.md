## Purpose
This repository contains the relevant code for a suite of tools relevant to my poker bot.

## Getting Started

#### Environment Variables
The bot requires the following environment variables to be set. This can be done by directly creating a `.env` file in the root directory of the project or using your IDE's environment variable settings.

| Environment Variable | Description                                 | Example Value       |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| `MONGO_DB_PASSWORD`  | Your password for your MongoDB account. Used to connect to your cluster.    | `1srLPLrvK0pd08OX`  |


## Exclusions
Currently, the bot does not contain `multithread.py`. This is the main file for training the poker bot. My training algorithm is proprietary, and I am not prepared to release it to the public at this time. If you would like to know more about the training algorithm, please contact me directly at `jonathan@caltech.edu`.
